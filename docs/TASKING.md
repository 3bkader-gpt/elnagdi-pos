## 2. Upcoming Features & Roadmap

### Milestone 1: Multi-Till Drawer Management (Three drawers)
To support diverse payment and utility operations, the supermarket requires tracking three distinct physical cash flows under each shift:
1.  **Main Supermarket Drawer:** Handles standard cash checkout invoices.
2.  **Momkn Utility Drawer:** Handles cash received/spent for the Momkn payment machine.
3.  **Mobile Wallets Drawer:** Vodafone Cash, Instapay transfers, and bank deposits.

#### Action Items:
- [ ] Create `momkn_transactions` and `mobile_money_transactions` schema tables.
- [ ] Implement `momkn.dao.js` and `mobile_money.dao.js`.
- [ ] Add `useMomknTill.js` and `useMobileMoneyTill.js` controller hooks.
- [ ] Create `TillsManagerTab.jsx` dashboard component for managers with sub-tabs.
- [ ] Design operation forms (modals) for utility payments and mobile money transfers.
- [ ] Implement thermal report templates for print-outs at shift handoff.

### Milestone 2: Cloud Sync & Automated Backups
- [ ] Create background task to sync encrypted db snapshots to cloud storage (e.g., Cloudflare R2 bucket) on shift close.
- [ ] Implement local database backup scheduler (spooling `.db` copies to secondary partition).
